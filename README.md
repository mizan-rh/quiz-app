## âœ… What I Have Done

- Route changes for admin and candidate user roles
- Middleware recreated for auth + role-based access control
- Dynamic dashboard redirect based on user role (admin/candidate)
- Email verification temporarily disabled
- Prisma schema updated with `Role` enum and relation
- Post-login redirection logic partially working (needs refinement)
- P.S. I will continue working on it at home
